# Contributing to the project

You can contribute in many ways to this project.


## Issue reporting

This is a good point to start, when you find a problem please add
it to the [issue tracke](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/issues).
The ideal report should include the steps to reproduce it.

## Doubts solving

To help less advanced users is another wonderful way to start. You can
help us close some opened issues. This kind of tickets should be
labeled as ``question``.

## Improvement proposal

If you have an idea for a new feature please open a ticket labeled as
``enhancement``. If you could also add a piece of code with the idea
or a partial implementation it would be awesome.

## Contributor License Agreement

We'd love to accept your code! Before we can, we have to get a few legal
requirements sorted out. By having you sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), we
ensure that the community is free to use your contributions.

When you contribute to the Qiskit project with a new pull request, a bot will
evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the bot will comment on
the pull request,  including a link to accept the agreement. The
[individual CLA](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-cla.pdf) document is
available for review as a PDF.

If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-corporate-cla.pdf)
and email it to us at qiskit@qiskit.org.
