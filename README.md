# QISKit simulators based on JKU's simulator

This module contains a [QISKit](https://www.qiskit.org/) simulator whose backend is based on JKU's simulator. These simulators simulate a quantum circuit on a classical computer.

## Installation

Install this module via the PIP tool:

```
pip install qiskit_addon_jku
```

PIP will handle all dependencies automatically.

## Usage

We recommend to follow the [usage example](examples/jku_backend.py). More general information and education on running quantum simulation can be found in the [QISKit instructions page](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-core) and the QISKit tutorials.
